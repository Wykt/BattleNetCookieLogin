# BattleNetCookieLogin
Connect with a cookie on battle.net launcher

# What it does
 + Overwrite your Battle.net.config with another one (the only user configuration in this file is language, which is replaced by en-US)
 + Ask for a cookie and encrypt it then save it in HKEY_CURRENT_USER/SOFTWARE/Blizzard Entertainment/Battle.net/UnifiedAuth/{value}

# Any issues?
 + Make sure you have default battle.net installation path (C:/Program Files(x86)/Battle.net)
 + Make sure that you have already logged in to an account with auto login enabled on battle.net launcher (this is required so subfolders in regedit are created)
 + If it still doesn't work, open an issue
